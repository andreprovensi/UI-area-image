# SMART - Surface Measurement Tool

This is a GUI developed in tkinter to measure the surface area of a lesion in a mouth image. The tool allows the user to load an image, define the known lengths of two points in the image, and select the area of the lesion using one of three methods: polygon, spline, or free draw. This software was developed for the department of odontology of Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC).
