Last year we had the opportunity of endeavoring in the world of healthcare alongside a distinct team of Professors and students from the Pathology Department at the Federal University of Santa Catarina.

We had the pleasure of developing this software, which is available for the entire world and helps health professionals, especially dentists, monitor oral lesions. The idea was to create a tool that allowed any dentist or physician to evaluate the surface area of relatively flat lesions, so tracking its evolution could be done in a more objective manner. This software was primarily developed to monitor oral lesions, however, its applicability goes way beyond that, into the field of Dermatology or any other field where area measurement is necessary.

This tool should allow not only a more accurate selection of treatment guidelines, but also improve research, given that scientists now have a way to more precisely evaluate lesion evolution. As a side benefit, creating an objective way of tracking lesions also facilitates communication between peers, even if they have not had personal contact with the patient or haven't been following the case from the beginning.

It is our pleasure to show this as an example of interdisciplinary work, where programming expertise is used to support healthcare. The software was developed in Python language and is available for download from the University's website.
