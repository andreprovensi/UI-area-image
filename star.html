    COOLING SYSTEM

            <th>S</th>
            <td>When I started at my current job, the project was already ongoing, and there was a component of the drone that could not operate on high temperatures and it was located close to a very hot region of the drone.  </td>

                A colleague of our team was evaluating this problem with numerical simulations and my task was to develop a analytical model to evaluate if an already proposed solution would keep the component at safe levels of temperature, compare the results with the ones of my coleague and report the results to the client.

            <td>
                First I had to learn about the project as a whole in order to better understand the problem. To do so I asked my coleagues, who helped me to quickly get the essential knowledge of the project. After that I used my knowledge in thermal sciences to develop an analytical model of the heat transfer in the region of the component during the mission of the drone.

            <td>
                My model showed that the implemented solution was able to keep the component temperature at safe levels during its operation. My results also were similar to those found by my coleague's simulations, which was very good, since this similarity gave us more security that our results were correct so we could report them to the client, who approved our report and calculations.

                One of the requiremtns of the clients was that the airbag should be filled in less than 10 seconds.

        <tr>
            <th>A</th>
            <td>
                Since this was also a problem related my master's and graduation background, I modeled the fluid flowing into the airbag for the engineer responsible for the system and calculated the time it took to the airbag to be filled.

                When we tested our system, it was capable to fill the airbag within the time requested by the client.

    ELICTRICAL SYSTEM - RANDOM VIBRATION
    <table border="">
        
        <tr>
            <th>S</th>
            <td>Our client needed to perform a random vibration test in two components of the electrical system in order to assure these componentes were in accordance with  standards for random vibration.</td>

        <tr>
            <th>T</th>
            <td>
                The task was to develop a finite element model to simulate the test and evaluate wether the componentes would resist the tests.
            </td>

            <td>
                The random vibration simulation is a problem more related to structural engineering, howerver despite my speciality being thermal sciences, I volunteered to work on this task to learn a new skill. Working together with an experienced structural engineer, I developed the FEM model for the random vibration test of the electrical componenent. 
            </td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
            <th>R</th>
            <td>
                The result of my FEM showed that component would resist the test and it did when the client performed the test ! This experience was very important to me because I could get out of my confort zone and work with an area of mechanical engineering that is not my speciality. I also could learn new abilities working with my structural engineering coleague, which certainly was very enrichfull to me
